<h1>Repertory Grids for Social Media</h1>

We chose the topic - Social Media and decided upon 10 different social networks. Each of us conducted one interview,
without any discussion with each other, and we all came up with different attributes that we used for our repertory grid.
Our repertory grid results were intriguing. Just looking at our results we see that Privacy as an attribute was our only
common attribute, which is a big deal in today's times.

All our clusters are mostly different, which isn't surprising since all our attributes are very different. The only common
attribute that One *similarity* we observed is that showed up was related to Privacy in the form of
HighPrivacyConcern:LowPrivacyConcern, LessSecure:MoreSecure and Secure:Insecure. Some interesting attribute clusters we saw were:

- Secure:Insecure and Information:Misinformation : Users are bound to relate information and security
- MoreSearchFriendly:LessSearchFriendly and UiIsIntuitive:UiIsNotIntuitive: Shows how UI plays a role in being user-friendly.
- DifficultyInContentSharing:EaseInContentSharing and LessTimeSpent:MoreTimeSpent: Shows how users attachment/addiction is also dependent on accessibility.

The last two sets show us how HCI is an important aspect of Social Media.

We also had two sets of attributes, from different interviews that were similar to an extent - **HighMentalHealthConcern:LowMentalHealthConcern
and HighPrivacyConcern:LowPrivacyConcern** in one interview and **FreeAccess:ParentalControls and Feeling Connected:FOMO** in another.
Our conclusion from this is that Human emotions are linked to Accessibility to our personal data.

Snapchat was a **constant outlier** in all our clustering results. To us, it indicated that Snapchat is the unique social network
we have right now, which goes along with the actual trend that Snapchat is a pioneer to most Social media features such as stories and disappearing messages.
Snapchat stood out with its attributes in a positive way either scoring very high or very low, which on comparing the attribute values
we observed that users gave higher points to the positive oriented attributes to Snapchat. In one of our clustering results, we have Facebook and Whatsapp in one cluster,
which is closer to the reality of them both being owned by Meta and thus having similar policies.
Apart from this, most of our clusters didn't make a lot of sense to us. This could be because of the different kinds of users we chose and how
their views of each social network has been different, which makes us think that Repertory grids might just do the job of eliminating bias.

We did find that the repertory grids show us a constructed knowledge of one individual per grid, and for vast domains such as social media
which can be covered with a very high number of attributes, manually looking at results can be time-consuming and prone to
errors. One approach we could try would be using the same attributes throughout each interview, but that might limit the
individual psychology we're looking for and end up bias through the attributes decided.
